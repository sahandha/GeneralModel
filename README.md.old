# GeneralModel

A general and easy way to simulate ODE's with minimal effort. There are some models that are pre-defined in the package. To study those, you only need to pass in the name. You can specify parameters for the model, but you don't have to. 
Time evolution plots and phase plots are available. You simply name the states to be plotted, and the system will take care of the details for you.

For an example demo, see [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/sahandha/GeneralModel/blob/master/demo.ipynb).
